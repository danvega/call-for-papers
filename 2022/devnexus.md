## REST API development in Java with Spring Boot

Long gone are the days of verbose & complicated web development in Java. The Spring Framework has become the world's most popular Java Framework thanks to its focus on speed, simplicity, and productivity.

In this session, you will learn the basics of how to create a new web application in Spring Boot, with the focus being on building REST APIs. You will learn best practices, data validation, data persistence, security, and how to document your APIs.

## An introduction to building Microservices in Java

In this session, you will learn what Microservices are and when you might want to reach for them. Microservices have become a popular architecture choice that produces independently releasable services modeled around a business domain.

You will begin this presentation by learning about the pros/cons of choosing a Microservice architecture. You will learn that the makeup of your team plays a major role in moving towards a Microservice-based architecture.

Once you understand the need for Microservices it's time to learn how to build them in Java. I will introduce you to building Microservices in Java using Spring Boot. We will discuss the different projects in the Spring ecosystem and what role each of them plays in our application.

We will do this by building out an application that is made up of several microservices. We will talk about how services communicate with each other as well as some of the other challenges with building distributed systems.

## Full-Stack Development with Spring Boot & Vue 3

Are you interested in building full-stack web applications with Spring Boot and Vue 3? If so, this session is going to give you everything you need to get started. You will learn some of the different approaches to building full-stack applications and the pros and cons to each.

First, we will look at how Vue is a progressive framework and will allow you to incrementally adopt it in your Java applications as your needs grow. Next, we will look at how to build a monolith application where you end up with a single deployable JAR. Finally, if your frontend and backend teams are separate, we will look at a solution for you.

When you leave this session, youâ€™ll have everything you need to start building full-stack web applications with Spring Boot and VueJS.
