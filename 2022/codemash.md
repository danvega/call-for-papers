## Full-Stack Development with Spring Boot & Vue 3

Are you interested in building full-stack web applications with Spring Boot and Vue 3? If so, this session is going to give you everything you need to get started. You will learn some of the different approaches to building full-stack applications and the pros and cons to each.

First, we will look at how Vue is a progressive framework and will allow you to incrementally adopt it in your Java applications as your needs grow. Next, we will look at how to build a monolith application where you end up with a single deployable JAR. Finally, if your frontend and backend teams are separate, we will look at a solution for you.

When you leave this session, youâ€™ll have everything you need to start building full-stack web applications with Spring Boot and VueJS.
## REST API development in Java with Spring Boot

Long gone are the days of verbose & complicated web development in Java. The Spring Framework has become the world's most popular Java Framework thanks to its focus on speed, simplicity, and productivity.

In this session, you will learn the basics of how to create a new web application in Spring Boot, with the focus being on building REST APIs. You will learn best practices, data validation, data persistence, security, and how to document your APIs.

## Vite - The next generation build tool for frontend development

Modern web applications are bundled using tools that crawl, process, and concatenate our source modules into files that can run in the browser. A lot of the tools in this space have greatly improved the development experience for frontend developers.

As the complexity of our applications grows so does the amount of JavaScript that we have to send to the browser. It can often take an unreasonably long wait (sometimes up to minutes) to spin up a dev server, and even with HMR, file edits can take a couple of seconds to be reflected in the browser.

In this session, you will learn about a framework-agnostic next-generation build tool called Vite. Vite aims to address these issues by leveraging new advancements in the ecosystem.

## So you want to create an online course? A Developers's guide to creating passive income.

In this session, I will teach you the tips and tricks that I have learned over the years that led me to create courses that have helped over 140,000 students worldwide. These courses have allowed me to create passive income all while sharing my passion, software development.

First, we will talk about how to validate your course ideas. Before you go off and put all of this effort into creating a course you want to make sure that it's something that people are interested in.

A course starts with an outcome, what will your students get if they take your course. We will discuss how to create a solid curriculum that revolves around your outcomes.

Finally, we will discuss what equipment you will need to have to create your first course. Your passion for a particular subject will determine the success of your course, not a fancy setup. The most important thing you can do is deliver on the promise of your material by producing quality content.

## An introduction to building Microservices in Java

In this session, you will learn what Microservices are and when you might want to reach for them. Microservices have become a popular architecture choice that produces independently releasable services modeled around a business domain. 

You will begin this presentation by learning about the pros/cons of choosing a Microservice architecture. You will learn that the makeup of your team plays a major role in moving towards a Microservice-based architecture. 

Once you understand the need for Microservices it's time to learn how to build them in Java. I will introduce you to building Microservices in Java using Spring Boot. We will discuss the different projects in the Spring ecosystem and what role each of them plays in our application. 

We will do this by building out an application that is made up of several microservices. We will talk about how services communicate with each other as well as some of the other challenges with building distributed systems.
