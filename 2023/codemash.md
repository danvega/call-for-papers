## Spring Recipes: A Collection of common-sense solutions

Over the years, Spring has evolved to solve the ever-increasing demands placed on software teams. From circuit breakers to security to queues to Kubernetes, Spring has an answer to that! But breadth can be overwhelming especially when you need to deploy to production yesterday. While knowing maybe half the battle, left unsaid is applying that knowledge to real-world situations; in other words, how do you bridge the gap between knowing Spring can do that to actually using Spring to fix your issue? With a plethora of examples, this talk will walk you through common problems in modern software development. From monitoring to testing to messaging to reactive programming, this talk will give you concrete solutions for your day-to-day needs.

In this session, you will learn about common situations you will encounter as a developer and how Spring can make the right thing to do the easy thing to do. Cutting through the cruft, you will leave armed with practical code examples you can use on your projects. This talk will touch on Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, APIs, microservices, persistence, testing, and much more. By the end of this session, you will be armed with the knowledge you need to confidently reach for the right tool the next time a problem arises!

## What’s new in Spring Boot 3.0

Spring Boot 3.0 was just released and it’s packed full of amazing new features. In this session, you will learn about some of the new and exciting enhancements that make this one of the most anticipated releases of Spring Boot EVER!

This release is headlined by the built-in AOT support for GraalVM’s native image. This is going to change the way you think about building applications going forward and opens up a whole new world of possibilities. Spring Boot 3 is moving towards a Java 17 baseline and Jakarta EE 9 and we will discuss what that means for you. By the end of this session, you will have everything you need to start building applications with Spring Boot 3.

## Give your APIs a REST & make to the move to GraphQL

In a world where multiple applications and devices are calling your APIs, you end up having to create custom endpoints for different views of your data. What if you could provide fewer endpoints and let the consumer decide on which data they need?

GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. GraphQL provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API, gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more, makes it easier to evolve APIs over time, and enables powerful developer tools.

In this session, you will learn the basic concepts of GraphQL. You will then learn how to use GraphQL in your Java applications with Spring for GraphQL. By the end of this presentation, you will be able to write and validate queries, create your own GraphQL API and write automated tests against them.

## Level up your Integration tests with Testcontainers

Traditional approaches to integration testing—using shared, local, or in-memory databases—fall short for today's modern developer. Developers today are building cloud native distributed microservices and taking advantage of a rich variety of backing services. This explosion of applications and backing services introduces new challenges in creating the necessary environments for integration testing. To be useful and effective, these environments must be easy to create and they must resemble production as closely as possible. New solutions are needed to make this need a reality.

Enter Testcontainers!

Testcontainers is a Java library that supports JUnit tests and makes it incredibly easy to create lightweight, throwaway instances of common databases, Selenium web browsers, or anything else that can run in a Docker container.

In this talk, you will learn when and how to use Testcontainers. We will cover the fundamentals and walk through a step-by-step example using a Spring Boot application that we build from scratch.

## Getting Started with Spring

If you’re a Java developer and want to learn about the most popular frameworks ever created this session is for you. You are going to learn what Spring is used for and how it can make you a more productive developer. It does this by providing you with the infrastructure to build enterprise-ready applications and allowing you to focus on features.

After an introduction to Spring, you will get familiar with the framework by building out a practical application. Along the way, you will learn about the core principles of Spring like Inversion of Control (IoC), dependency injection, beans, application context, and more.

Building a new application isn’t much use if you can’t get it to production. You will learn about the different approaches to moving your application to the greatest place on the planet, production!  By the end of this session, you will have what you need to start building enterprise-grade applications with Spring.
