## Supercharge your Vue 3 applications with AWS Lambda

Are you interested in learning how to get up and running with Serverless functions quickly? If so this session will have everything you need to understand what serverless functions are and how to create, test, and deploy them.

In this session, you will learn how to create serverless functions using Netlify Functions. Netlify functions make it easy to write your functions in JavaScript, TypeScript, or Go and have them deployed for you to AWS as Lambda functions. This allows you to create API endpoints that you can execute within your Vue 3 applications.

By the end of this presentation, you will learn how to create Netlify functions, test them locally and deploy them to AWS. You will also learn the different use cases for serverless functions and when you might want to reach for them. Did I mention you can do this on Netlify for FREE?
