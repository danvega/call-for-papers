## REST Assured, your API's are secured

With the rise in popularity in JavaScript frameworks like Angular, Vue and React more and more functionality is moving to the client. With this architecture, we are often asking ourselves how do I secure my REST services?

In this session, you will learn what your options are for securing your APIs and some pros and cons to each. You will learn how to build a simple REST service using Spring Boot and how to secure it. You will also learn the difference between authentication and authorization and they fit into securing your API's. Finally you will take a small application written in Vue and integrate your REST API into it.

You will walk away from this session understanding how to secure your REST API's. You will also have a practical example that shows how this works in the real world.
