## Progressive Web Apps are the @!#\$

In this introduction to PWA's, I am going to tell you what they are and why you should care about them. PWA's are helping us create a better experience for everyone that is using the web by creating faster, more reliable web applications. Progressive web applications are installable on mobile and desktop without the need for an app store. They offer an immersive full-screen distraction free experience so that your users can consume your content. If you want to learn what PWA's are and walk away with the actionable steps on how to create them (it's fairly simple by the way) then you must attend my session.

## TypeScript Support in Vue

At this point you have heard about this rising framework called Vue. A friend or colleague probably told you about it or you heard it on a podcast. You want to take a look at it but you're a TypeScript developer and aren't sure about the support for TS in Vue.

In this session you will learn about the built-in TypeScript support in the Vue CLI. You will also learn about the updates in Vue 3.x that will considerably improve the TypeScript support with built-in class based components API and TSX support. You will walk away from this session with the tools and knowledge to start building Vue applications using TypeScript.
