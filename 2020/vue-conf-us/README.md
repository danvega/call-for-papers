## Vue 3.0 Better, Faster & Stronger

Vue has just released (at the time of this presentation in 2020) it's long-awaited v3 and there are a ton of new features to get excited about. In this presentation we are going to cover some of the highlights with code examples of what's included in VueJS 3.0:

- Function-based Component API
- Proxy-based observer implementation
- Reactivity Updates (Goodbye Reactivity Caveats)
- Multiple Root Nodes
- Simpler Transparent Wrappers
- New Slot Syntax
- Rewritten in TypeScript (No you don't need to learn TypeScript)
- Huge Performance Improvements (Smaller & Faster)
- Much more

It's great to hear what is new in Vue 3 for those who are building new applications but what about those of us who have to update existing applications. What does the upgrade path from 2.x to 3.x look like? In this presentation, we will also cover some tools that will help you upgrade your existing applications to 3.0.

## A beginners guide to testing in Vue.js

Every developer knows they should be writing tests, but if we are being honest here, the majority of us don't do it at all or we don't do enough of it. If it's something that we know we should be doing, why aren't we? The problem isn't the lack of tools, it's that we don't have a clear understanding of what these tools are meant to do.

The problems most developers face when it comes to testing are lack of motivation and the inability to determine what you should be writing tests for and most importantly what you shouldn't be testing. In this presentation, I will introduce you to how to test single-file components in Vue. We will do this by identifying what to test in a component, what not to test and the tools available for testing in VueJS.

## Moving my blog from WordPress to Gridsome

This year I moved my blog from WordPress to Gridsome. In this presentation, I will share with you my motivation for doing so and what I learned in the process.

Static Site Generators (SSGs) built on the JAM Stack are all the rage these days and rightfully so. In the Vue ecosystem, we are really lucky to have this amazing framework called Gridsome which makes it easy for developers to build modern websites, apps, and PWAs that are really fast by default.

After we talk about why I made the move I will show you just how easy it is to build your own blog using Gridsome.

## How to make the move from jQuery to Vue

For a long time in my development career, I would avoid front end development as much as possible because JavaScript was just not fun to work with. Then this magical library called jQuery came into my life and changed everything. In fact, JavaScript took notice and begin implementing similar features that have since made the language a lot more fun to work with.

In the past year and a half, I really embraced VueJS as a framework, community and a way to produce high-quality applications. Vue is the perfect choice for fans of jQuery to move to because it's a progressive framework, but what does that even mean.

Unlike other monolithic frameworks, Vue is designed from the ground up to be incrementally adoptable. The core library is focused on the view layer only and is easy to pick up and integrate with other libraries or existing projects. This means that we can introduce Vue into our existing projects one feature at a time and don't have to live with that all or nothing mentality.

In this workshop, I will give you an introduction to Vue and show you how to incrementally adopt and replace jQuery with it.
