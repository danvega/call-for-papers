## Vue 3.0 Better, Faster & Stronger

Vue has just released (at the time of this presentation in 2020) it's long-awaited v3 and there are a ton of new features to get excited about. In this presentation we are going to cover some of the highlights with code examples of what's included in VueJS 3.0:

- Function-based Component API
- Proxy-based observer implementation
- Reactivity Updates (Goodbye Reactivity Caveats)
- Multiple Root Nodes
- Simpler Transparent Wrappers
- New Slot Syntax
- Rewritten in TypeScript (No you don't need to learn TypeScript)
- Huge Performance Improvements (Smaller & Faster)
- Much more

It's great to hear what is new in Vue 3 for those who are building new applications but what about those of us who have to update existing applications. What does the upgrade path from 2.x to 3.x look like? In this presentation, we will also cover some tools that will help you upgrade your existing applications to 3.0.

## How to make the move from jQuery to Vue

For a long time in my development career, I would avoid front end development as much as possible because JavaScript was just not fun to work with. Then this magical library called jQuery came into my life and changed everything. In fact, JavaScript took notice and begin implementing similar features which have since made the language a lot more fun to work with.

In the past year and a half, I really embraced VueJS as a framework, community and a way to produce high-quality applications. Vue is the perfect choice for fans of jQuery to move to because it's a progressive framework, but what does that even mean.

Unlike other monolithic frameworks, Vue is designed from the ground up to be incrementally adoptable. The core library is focused on the view layer only and is easy to pick up and integrate with other libraries or existing projects. This means that we can introduce Vue into our existing projects one feature at a time and don't have to live with that all or nothing mentality.

In this presentation, I will give you an introduction to Vue and show you how to incrementally adopt and replace some jQuery functionality.

## A beginners guide to testing in Vue.js

Every developer knows they should be writing tests, but if we are being honest here, the majority of us don't do it at all or we don't do enough of it. If it's something that we know we should be doing, why aren't we? The problem isn't the lack of tools, it's that we don't have a clear understanding of what these tools are meant to do.

The problems most developers face when it comes to testing are lack of motivation and the inability to determine what you should be writing tests for and most importantly what you shouldn't be testing. In this presentation, I will introduce you to how to test single-file components in Vue. We will do this by identifying what to test in a component, what not to test and the tools available for testing in VueJS.

## Functional Component API in Vue 3

New in Vue 3.0 is a feature called the Function-based Component API. This new feature gives us a really great way to write composable components in Vue. In this presentation, we will take a look at why the new function-based component API was added to Vue. We will also look at some code examples of how to build components using the new API.

Finally, I also want to make sure you understand that you shouldn't go off and rewrite all of your applications using this new API. We will talk about when it's a good idea to write function-based components and how most of the template-based API is a good default choice.

## Introduction to Micronaut

Micronaut is a new JVM-based framework that will help you build light and modular applications. This framework was created by OCI, the same company behind the Grails Framework. Micronaut supports a variety of languages like Java, Groovy and Kotlin.

With its focus on modularity, minimal footprint and short startup times, it is a great solution from running in serverless environments. In this presentation, I will introduce you to the Micronaut framework. You will learn how to build basic API's that can serve a variety of purposes. I like to use it as the backend for my Vue applications as well as microservices that run as serverless functions.

## Acquire new skills fast: A guide to continued learning and personal growth

A popular Chinese proverb states: “The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is now.” Dan Vega, a self-taught programmer with 20+ years of experience in Software Development, will share life lessons that helped turn his lifelong passion for learning (and teaching) into an exciting career.

Do you find yourself overwhelmed with a list of things you would like to learn but have no idea where to start? In this session, we will debunk myths that it takes monumental amounts of effort and time to learn a new skill. You will walk away from this presentation with a specific plan on how you can acquire new skills rapidly.
