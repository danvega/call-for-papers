## Vue 3.0 Better, Faster & Stronger

Vue has just released (at the time of this presentation in 2020) it's long-awaited v3 and there are a ton of new features to get excited about. In this presentation we are going to cover some of the highlights with code examples of what's included in VueJS 3.0:

- Function-based Component API
- Proxy-based observer implementation
- Reactivity Updates (Goodbye Reactivity Caveats)
- Multiple Root Nodes
- Simpler Transparent Wrappers
- New Slot Syntax
- Rewritten in TypeScript (No you don't need to learn TypeScript)
- Huge Performance Improvements (Smaller & Faster)
- Much more

It's great to hear what is new in Vue 3 for those who are building new applications but what about those of us who have to update existing applications. What does the upgrade path from 2.x to 3.x look like? In this presentation, we will also cover some tools that will help you upgrade your existing applications to 3.0.

## A beginners guide to testing in Vue.js

Every developer knows they should be writing tests, but if we are being honest here, the majority of us don't do it at all or we don't do enough of it. If it's something that we know we should be doing, why aren't we? The problem isn't the lack of tools, it's that we don't have a clear understanding of what these tools are meant to do.

The problems most developers face when it comes to testing are lack of motivation and the inability to determine what you should be writing tests for and most importantly what you shouldn't be testing. In this presentation, I will introduce you to how to test single-file components in Vue. We will do this by identifying what to test in a component, what not to test and the tools available for testing in VueJS.

## Moving my blog from WordPress to Gridsome

This year I moved my blog from WordPress to Gridsome. In this presentation, I will share with you my motivation for doing so and what I learned in the process.

Static Site Generators (SSGs) built on the JAM Stack are all the rage these days and rightfully so. In the Vue ecosystem, we are really lucky to have this amazing framework called Gridsome which makes it easy for developers to build modern websites, apps, and PWAs that are really fast by default.

After we talk about why I made the move I will show you just how easy it is to build your own blog using Gridsome.

## Serverless and Vue

Abstract:
What is serverless and what are the use cases serverless is good for? I will answer these questions and show you how you can quickly add serverless functions to your Vue application.

Description:
When you write a Vue application there is often a need for data or business logic. Many times you will see this in the form of a server-side API. But what happens when you need to perform some function that doesn't warrant standing up an entire server?

In this presentation, I will walk through some of the use cases that I have come across for creating serverless function. We will look at when to use them and more importantly when not reach for them. Finally, you will learn how to create your very first serverless function using Netlify.
