## Progressive Web Apps are the @!#\$

In this introduction to PWA's, I am going to tell you what they are and why you should care about them. PWA's are helping us create a better experience for everyone that is using the web by creating faster, more reliable web applications. Progressive web applications are installable on mobile and desktop without the need for an app store. They offer an immersive full-screen distraction free experience so that your users can consume your content. If you want to learn what PWA's are and walk away with the actionable steps on how to create them (it's fairly simple by the way) then you must attend my session.

## Static Site Generators in VueJS

While large server-side monolithic applications still exist, the industry is in the middle of a major shift away from them. With the advancement of JavaScript frameworks and the language itself, we are pushing more and more to the client these days. This trend in web development has been dubbed JAMStack, which stands for JavaScript + API + Markup.

With the shift towards JAMStack, Static Site Generators (SSGs) are becoming more and more popular. In this session, we are going to clear up any questions you might have about what SSGs are and what you can build with them. Specifically, we are going to look at the landscape of SSGs in the Vue ecosystem. We will create a simple application and discuss your options for deploying your static site.
